Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.


> abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details of a program, exposing only the API required to use the implementation. 
> A Java program is also a great example of abstraction. Here java takes care of converting simple statements to machine language and hides the inner implementation details from the outer world.

To acheive  abstraction :
> abstract class (0-100%)
> Interface (100%)

Advantages of abstraction :
> Security
> Enhancement - For example if we are changing or upgrading software we have just way of implementing , set of rules remains same .
> enhances loose coupling


Abstract class :
> It cannot be instantiated 
> It must be extended to a class in order to use .


Interface :

> It is set of rules 
> all variables are by default final and static
> upto java 8 all methods were abstract in interface
>  after java 8 we can define default method and static method in interface.
